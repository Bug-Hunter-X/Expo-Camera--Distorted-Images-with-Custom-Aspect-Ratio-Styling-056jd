This bug occurs when using Expo's `Camera` component with custom styling.  The issue arises when applying styles that affect the aspect ratio of the preview, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect image capture.  For instance, setting `width` and `height` styles directly on the `Camera` component can cause the preview to be stretched or compressed, resulting in distorted images. The problem is compounded when trying to maintain a specific aspect ratio while accommodating different screen sizes.
